  Austin now supports Python 3.3, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.7 on x86_64 Linux.


2018-09-26 v0.2.0-alpha

  Austin can now be attached to a running Python 3 process.

  Added new command line options:

    - --alt-format, -a:

        Use the alternative format for collapsed stack samples.

    - --exclude-empty, -e:

        Exclude samples of threads with no frame stacks.

        Usually, these are Python threads created by C extensions, whose code
        cannot currently be traced.

    - --sleepless, -s:

        Suppress idle samples.

        These are samples where a call to wait has been made and the thread
        sits there doing nothing.

  Fixed a bug that caused some valid thread samples to be marked as invalid.

  Austin has been tested successfully on Windows 10 64-bit via WSL.
