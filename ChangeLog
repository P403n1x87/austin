2019-07-28 v0.7.0

  Austin can now profile memory usage and output samples to a file.

  Added new command line options:

    - --memory, -m:

        Switch to memory profling mode

    - --full, -f:

        Generate samples with a full set of metrics, which include timing and
        memory prifiling information. Note that the output from this mode needs
        to be processed before it can be used with FlameGraph.

    - --output, -o:

        Designate an output file for the collected samples.


2018-10-15 v0.6.0-beta

  Introduced native support for MacOS and Windows.


2018-10-10 v0.5.0-beta

  Added support for all the major releases of Python 2 and 3 on 32-bit Linux.


2018-10-08 v0.4.0-alpha

  Added support for all the major releases of Python 2 and 3 on 64-bit Linux.


2018-10-02 v0.3.1-alpha

  Bugfix: Austin can now attach to a running Python process again.


2018-09-30 v0.3.0-alpha

  Austin now supports Python 3.3, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.7 on x86_64 Linux.


2018-09-26 v0.2.0-alpha

  Austin can now be attached to a running Python 3 process.

  Added new command line options:

    - --alt-format, -a:

        Use the alternative format for collapsed stack samples.

    - --exclude-empty, -e:

        Exclude samples of threads with no frame stacks.

        Usually, these are Python threads created by C extensions, whose code
        cannot currently be traced.

    - --sleepless, -s:

        Suppress idle samples.

        These are samples where a call to wait has been made and the thread
        sits there doing nothing.

  Fixed a bug that caused some valid thread samples to be marked as invalid.

  Austin has been tested successfully on Windows 10 64-bit via WSL.
