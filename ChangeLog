2021-06-13 v3.0.0

  Added pipe mode.

  Bugfix: fixed file descriptor leak on Linux.

  Bugfix: fixed sampling duration reporting on macOS.

  The format of the emitted samples has been changed into something easier to
  parse.

  The sleepless mode now gives an estimate of CPU time.

  Binaries with arbitrary names are now supported, allowing Austin to easily

  Substantial performance improvements. Austin 2 can sample deep call stacks
  5 to 8 times faster than previous versions.

  Support for Python 3.9.

  Added the exposure option to instruct Austin to sample for a given number of
  seconds only (#53).


2020-05-16 v1.0.1

  Bugfix: Fixed broken support for Python 3.8 on MacOS.


2019-07-28 v1.0.0

  Austin can now profile multi-process Python application:

    When attaching Austin to an already running multi-process application it is
    enough to provide the process ID of the parent process. Austin will then
    discover all the child processes and profile those too.

    To tell Austin to look for child processes, use the new -C switch from the
    command line.

  Austin can now profile Python 3.8 applications.


2019-07-28 v0.7.0

  Austin can now profile memory usage and output samples to a file.

  Added new command line options:

    - --memory, -m:

        Switch to memory profling mode

    - --full, -f:

        Generate samples with a full set of metrics, which include timing and
        memory profiling information. Note that the output from this mode needs
        to be processed before it can be used with FlameGraph.

    - --output, -o:

        Designate an output file for the collected samples.


2018-10-15 v0.6.0-beta

  Introduced native support for MacOS and Windows.

  Added new command line options:

    - --alt-format, -a:

        Use the alternative format for collapsed stack samples.

    - --exclude-empty, -e:

        Exclude samples of threads with no frame stacks.

        Usually, these are Python threads created by C extensions, whose code
        cannot currently be traced.

    - --sleepless, -s:

        Suppress idle samples.

        These are samples where a call to wait has been made and the thread
        sits there doing nothing.

  Fixed a bug that caused some valid thread samples to be marked as invalid.

  Austin has been tested successfully on Windows 10 64-bit via WSL.
