summary: A Python frame stack sampler for CPython
description: |
  Austin is a Python frame stack sampler for CPython written in pure C. It
  samples the stack traces of a Python application so that they can be
  visualised and analysed. As such, it serves the basis for building powerful
  profilers for Python.
